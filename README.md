## About

Initially, I had to consider the current situation in Sri Lankan to get an idea about what I going to build. So I found a very serious problem that every teacher who teaches to grade 1-5 students and also a student and their parents had. That is not efficient in online learning because It is difficult to stay students who are studying grade 1-5  with computer and Online meeting. Actually, they are kids so they would like to play some games, dance, sing, and they usually unable to concentrate their minds on online studies. So Parents should have to stay with them during the online meeting or online study times. You know It is not possible. To that problem, I decide to make a VIRTUAL LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM with AI POWERD 3D Character 

### How it works

This system work as a normal Learning Management System . and as well as this Virtual environment changes according to the student's (user's) facial expression. Like, System change the difficulty level of questions, change the content of questions, play some game with the student, talk with the student and etc.

## Features

- Student's facial expression detection.
- AI-powered 3D character to interact with the student,
- Text to Speech to give a response to student,
- All aspect change according to each student 
- All learning management features
- Random and dynamic question (unpredictable)
